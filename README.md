# Binary Tree

This python file implements a full binary tree class and the basic functions of the tree such as searches, insertions, & deletions of nodes.

## Installation

Open your terminal, then copy & paste the command in your desired directory location

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrew011002/Binary-Tree
```

## Running
The main code at the bottom of the file has some starter code that gives you a basic idea of what the functions and tree class does as a whole. You can play around with the tree class to get a better understanding or even add some better functionality to make it unique. There's some other files that show the basic traversing algorithms and searches in tree class too.
